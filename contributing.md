After running the Youtube_Downloader.py file as admin, if you're in a country where Youtube is filtered you would use VPN.

After that, you would paste your video link on Youtube to the first text box in the app with the Paste button or with Ctrl+V.

In the next text box enter the path or location of your folder that you prefer to save the downloaded file in it.

In the third part, you would to chose the quality of the video to download or select the mp3 file.

After those parts are finished, click the Download button to start the download(this may take a while to download start)

After getting the message that the download is finished you can open your file.
Note: after downloading the file if you want to download another file too, you should exit and re-run the app.

Hope you enjoy it.

Pouriakr✌️.
